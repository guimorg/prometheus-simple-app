# Simple Prometheus Application

This is a very simple Python Flask application designed to understand how Prometheus can be used to collect very simple metrics. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source (*pull-*)monitoring system and is used on many applications, check the documentation for more info!

This is heavily inspired by [ChristopherGS](https://github.com/trainindata/testing-and-monitoring-ml-deployments).
